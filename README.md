# AI-Driven RTS Game - MVP Implementation

A competitive 1v1 RTS where players command AI minions using natural language, powered by Godot 4 and OpenAI.

## Project Overview

This is an innovative RTS game where each player controls up to 10 personality-driven robotic minions through natural language commands. The AI interprets these commands via OpenAI and converts them into multi-step tactical plans that units execute over several seconds.

### Key Features
- **Natural Language Control**: Issue commands in plain English
- **Vision-Based AI**: Units only know what they can see (120¬∞ cone, 30m range)
- **Personality System**: Each unit has a customizable system prompt affecting behavior
- **Multi-Step Planning**: AI generates complex plans with conditional triggers
- **Speech Bubbles**: Units communicate their actions with personality
- **Node Capture**: Control strategic points to build structures
- **Deterministic Multiplayer**: Lock-step networking for competitive play
