## üî• **IMMEDIATE CRITICAL PRIORITIES**

### **Priority 1: Fix Critical Issues**
- **Server Crashes**: Resolve headless mode rendering crashes (`handle_crash: Program crashed with signal 11`)
- **InputMap Actions**: Add shift/ctrl selection modifiers (`Input.is_action_pressed("shift")` errors)
- **Signal Connections**: Fix missing UI feedback connections (`selection_changed` signal)
- **Client Migration**: Complete migration to use dedicated server architecture

### **Priority 2: Implement Missing MVP System**
- **üß† Multi-Step Plan Execution System**: This is the **CRITICAL GAP** from the original MVP
  - Current system only does direct commands
  - MVP required sophisticated multi-step plans with triggers (e.g., "health_pct < 20")
  - LLM should generate complex plans that units execute over time
  - **See [LLM_PLAN_EXECUTION_SYSTEM.md](LLM_PLAN_EXECUTION_SYSTEM.md) for complete specification**

### **Priority 3: Complete Core Gameplay**
- **Building System**: Power Spire, Defense Tower, Relay Pad
- **Node Capture**: 9 strategic control points with victory conditions
- **Resource Management**: Energy generation/consumption system
- **Speech Bubbles**: Unit communication system (12-word limit)

## üí° **WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL**

### **Revolutionary Innovations (Beyond Original Plan)**
1. **Cooperative Team Control**: 2v2 matches where teammates share control of same 5 units
2. **Dual-Architecture System**: Both standalone client AND dedicated server infrastructure
3. **Advanced AI Integration**: Context-aware natural language processing
4. **Enterprise Networking**: ENet-based server supporting 100+ clients
5. **Real-time Team Coordination**: Live teammate status and command tracking

### **Technical Achievements**
- **‚úÖ 5 Unit Archetypes**: Scout, Tank, Sniper, Medic, Engineer (complete)
- **‚úÖ Vision System**: 120¬∞ detection cones with line-of-sight (complete)
- **‚úÖ Combat System**: Damage, health, team-based mechanics (complete)
- **‚úÖ AI Command Processing**: Natural language to game commands (complete)
- **‚úÖ Cooperative Multiplayer**: Revolutionary shared unit control (complete)

## üéØ **YOUR MISSION**

### **Immediate Tasks (Week 6)**
1. **Diagnose and fix server crashes** - Critical blocking issue
2. **Complete client migration** to dedicated server architecture
3. **Implement the Multi-Step Plan Execution System** (see LLM_PLAN_EXECUTION_SYSTEM.md)
4. **Add missing InputMap actions** for selection modifiers

### **Short-term Goals (Weeks 7-9)**
1. **Building System**: Implement Power Spire, Defense Tower, Relay Pad
2. **Node Capture**: 9 strategic control points with victory conditions
3. **Resource Management**: Energy generation and consumption
4. **Speech Bubbles**: Unit communication with 12-word limit

### **Long-term Goals (Weeks 10-12)**
1. **UI/UX Polish**: Main menu, minimap, advanced interfaces
2. **Post-Match Systems**: ELO rating, replays, statistics
3. **Performance Optimization**: 500+ client capacity
4. **Production Deployment**: Containerization and auto-scaling

## üìä **CURRENT CODEBASE STRUCTURE**

### **Main Project (`/`)**
- **Standalone Client**: Fully functional cooperative RTS
- **Core Systems**: Unit management, selection, combat, vision
- **AI Integration**: Natural language command processing
- **Testing**: Comprehensive validation framework

### **Dedicated Server (`/game-server/`)**
- **Headless Server**: ENet-based multiplayer infrastructure
- **Server-Authoritative**: Physics, combat, state management
- **Session Management**: Multi-client game sessions
- **AI Integration**: Server-side AI command processing

### **Key Scripts**
- `scripts/core/unit.gd` - Unit base class with state machine
- `scripts/core/selection_manager.gd` - Unit selection system
- `scripts/ai/ai_command_processor.gd` - AI command processing
- `game-server/multiplayer/server_unit.gd` - Server-side units
- `game-server/server/dedicated_server.gd` - Main server logic

## üö® **CRITICAL NOTES**

### **Server Crash Issue**
The dedicated server crashes in headless mode due to rendering thread issues:
```
handle_crash: Program crashed with signal 11
RenderingDevice::make_current() (in Godot) + 16
```
This is blocking all server development and must be resolved first.

### **Missing MVP System**
The **Multi-Step Plan Execution System** is the core differentiator from the original MVP. Without it, the game is just "RTS with AI commands" instead of "AI-driven RTS with sophisticated behavior." This system allows units to execute complex, multi-step plans with triggers and timing.

### **Documentation is Clean**
All redundant documentation has been removed. The remaining 10 files are the single source of truth for each topic. Don't create duplicate documentation.
