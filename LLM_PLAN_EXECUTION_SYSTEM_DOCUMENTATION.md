# üß† LLM Plan Execution System - Implementation Documentation

## üìã **System Overview**

The LLM Plan Execution System is a revolutionary AI framework that transforms natural language commands into sophisticated, multi-step tactical plans executed over time with conditional logic and triggers. This system differentiates the AI-RTS from simple command-based games by enabling truly intelligent, emergent tactical behavior.

### **Core Philosophy**
Instead of simple commands like "move here" or "attack that", players can give complex tactical instructions like:
- **"Scout ahead, then attack if safe"** ‚Üí Multi-step plan with conditional logic
- **"Retreat if health drops below 20%"** ‚Üí Plan with health-based triggers
- **"Set up defensive positions and hold"** ‚Üí Coordinated multi-unit tactics

## üß© **Core Components**

### **1. ActionValidator (`scripts/ai/action_validator.gd`)**

**Purpose**: Validates AI-generated plans for safety, appropriateness, and game balance.

**Key Features**:
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures plan structure integrity
- **Action Whitelisting**: Only allows approved actions
- **Safety Limits**: Enforces duration/step limits
- **Parameter Validation**: Checks coordinate bounds and values
- **Speech Moderation**: Filters inappropriate content

**Safety Limits**:
```gdscript
const MAX_PLAN_DURATION = 6.0  # seconds
const MAX_STEPS_PER_PLAN = 8
const MAX_SPEECH_LENGTH = 12  # words
const ALLOWED_ACTIONS = [
    "move_to", "attack", "peek_and_fire", "lay_mines", 
    "hijack_enemy_spire", "retreat", "patrol", "use_ability", 
    "formation", "stance"
]
```

**Validation Process**:
1. Schema validation (required fields, data types)
2. Action whitelisting (only approved actions)
3. Parameter validation (bounds checking, type validation)
4. Duration limits (prevent infinite loops)
5. Speech content moderation (appropriate language)

### **2. PlanExecutor (`scripts/ai/plan_executor.gd`)**

**Purpose**: Executes multi-step plans with sophisticated timing, triggers, and conditional logic.

**Key Features**:
- **Multi-step Execution**: Sequential step processing
- **Conditional Triggers**: Health, distance, time-based conditions
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous state evaluation
- **Plan Interruption**: Emergency plan cancellation
- **Speech Integration**: Timed speech bubble display

**Trigger System**:
```gdscript
# Health-based triggers
"health_pct < 20"    # Retreat when health below 20%
"health_pct > 80"    # Attack when healthy

# Distance-based triggers
"enemy_dist < 10"    # Engage when enemy is close
"enemy_dist > 50"    # Disengage when enemy is far

# Time-based triggers
"time > 3"          # Execute after 3 seconds
"time < 1"          # Quick execution window
```

**Step Execution Flow**:
1. **Plan Validation**: Validate incoming plan
2. **Step Initialization**: Set up first step
3. **Trigger Evaluation**: Check completion conditions
4. **Action Execution**: Execute current step
5. **Progress Monitoring**: Track step completion
6. **Speech Display**: Show unit communication
7. **Next Step**: Advance to next step or complete plan

### **3. Enhanced AI Command Processor (`scripts/ai/ai_command_processor.gd`)**

**Purpose**: Bridges natural language commands with both direct actions and multi-step plans.

**Dual Command Processing**:
```gdscript
# Direct Commands (simple actions)
{
    "type": "direct_commands",
    "commands": [{"action": "MOVE", "parameters": {"position": [x, y, z]}}],
    "message": "Moving units to position"
}

# Multi-Step Plans (complex tactics)
{
    "type": "multi_step_plan",
    "plans": [{
        "unit_id": "scout_1",
        "steps": [
            {
                "action": "move_to",
                "params": {"position": [20, 0, 30]},
                "duration_ms": 2000,
                "speech": "Scouting ahead"
            },
            {
                "action": "retreat",
                "trigger": "enemy_dist < 15",
                "speech": "Enemies spotted, falling back"
            }
        ]
    }]
}
```

**AI Integration**:
- **Context Building**: Comprehensive game state analysis
- **Intelligent Routing**: Auto-detects simple vs complex commands
- **Plan Assignment**: Smart unit assignment for plans
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery
- **Queue Management**: Command queuing and prioritization

## üöÄ **Emergent Behavior Enhancements**

### **Current Limitations**
The current system, while revolutionary, has several areas for enhancement to create truly emergent behaviors:

1. **Static Plans**: Plans are predetermined and don't adapt to changing conditions
2. **Limited Inter-Unit Communication**: Units execute plans independently
3. **No Learning**: System doesn't learn from successful/failed tactics
4. **Simple Triggers**: Basic conditional logic without complex reasoning
5. **No Dynamic Goal Setting**: Plans don't generate new sub-goals

### **üß† Proposed Enhancements for Emergent Behavior**

#### **1. Dynamic Plan Adaptation System**
```gdscript
# Enhanced PlanStep with adaptation capabilities
class AdaptivePlanStep:
    var base_action: String
    var adaptation_rules: Array[AdaptationRule]
    var context_awareness: ContextMonitor
    var success_probability: float
    
    func adapt_to_context(current_context: Dictionary) -> PlanStep:
        for rule in adaptation_rules:
            if rule.should_adapt(current_context):
                return rule.create_adapted_step(self, current_context)
        return self
```

**Implementation**:
- **Context Monitoring**: Continuous environmental analysis
- **Adaptation Rules**: Dynamic plan modification based on conditions
- **Success Prediction**: ML model predicting plan success probability
- **Real-time Replanning**: Automatic plan adjustment during execution

#### **2. Inter-Unit Communication and Coordination**
```gdscript
# Unit Communication System
class UnitCommunication:
    var shared_knowledge: Dictionary
    var communication_range: float = 15.0
    var message_queue: Array[UnitMessage]
    
    func broadcast_intelligence(info: Dictionary) -> void:
        # Share tactical information with nearby units
        
    func request_support(support_type: String) -> void:
        # Request help from nearby units
        
    func coordinate_action(action: String, allies: Array) -> void:
        # Coordinate simultaneous actions
```

**Features**:
- **Intelligence Sharing**: Units share enemy positions, health status

        # Record plan success/failure for learning
        
    func suggest_improvements(current_plan: Plan) -> Array[Enhancement]:
        # Suggest plan improvements based on past experience
        
    func generate_counter_tactics(enemy_behavior: EnemyPattern) -> Array[CounterTactic]:
        # Generate tactics to counter observed enemy patterns
```

**Learning Mechanisms**:
- **Success Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful tactical combinations

# Dynamic Goal Management
class GoalHierarchy:
    var strategic_goals: Array[StrategicGoal]
    var tactical_goals: Array[TacticalGoal]
    var immediate_goals: Array[ImmediateGoal]
    
    func generate_sub_goals(parent_goal: Goal) -> Array[Goal]:
        # Dynamically create sub-goals to achieve parent goal
        
    func prioritize_goals(available_resources: Array) -> Array[Goal]:
        # Prioritize goals based on resources and situation
        
    func adapt_goals_to_context(context: GameContext) -> void:
        # Modify goals based on changing game state
```

**Goal Types**:
- **Strategic**: Control territory, eliminate enemy commander
- **Tactical**: Flanking maneuvers, resource control
- **Immediate**: Heal wounded unit, retreat from danger
- **Emergent**: Goals that arise from situational awareness

#### **5. Behavioral Personality System**
```gdscript
# Unit Personality Traits
class UnitPersonality:
    var aggression: float = 0.5        # 0 = defensive, 1 = aggressive
    var cooperation: float = 0.7       # Willingness to help others
    var risk_tolerance: float = 0.4    # Willingness to take risks
    var adaptability: float = 0.6      # How quickly unit adapts
    
    func influence_decision(base_plan: Plan) -> Plan:
        # Modify plan based on personality traits
        
    func respond_to_stress(stress_level: float) -> BehaviorModification:
        # Change behavior under pressure
```

**Personality Effects**:
- **Aggressive Units**: More likely to pursue enemies, take risks

        # Create optimal formation based on terrain and threats
        
    func adapt_formation_realtime(current_formation: Formation, threats: Array) -> Formation:
        # Dynamically adjust formation during combat
```

**Formation Features**:
- **Terrain Adaptation**: Formations adapt to hills, chokepoints
- **Threat Response**: Formations counter specific enemy types

```gdscript
# Advanced Situational Awareness
class SituationalAwareness:
    var threat_predictor: ThreatPredictor
    var opportunity_detector: OpportunityDetector
    var resource_analyzer: ResourceAnalyzer
    
    func predict_enemy_actions(enemy_state: EnemyState) -> Array[PredictedAction]:
        # Predict likely enemy actions based on behavior patterns
        
    func identify_opportunities(game_state: GameState) -> Array[TacticalOpportunity]:
        # Identify tactical opportunities in current situation
        
    func assess_risks(proposed_action: Action) -> RiskAssessment:
        # Evaluate risks of proposed actions
```

**Awareness Features**:
- **Predictive Analysis**: Anticipate enemy movements
