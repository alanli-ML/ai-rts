# Implementation Status & Next Steps

## 1. Current Status Summary

The project's core systems are stable. The major refactor is complete, and the client-host architecture is functioning correctly. The gameplay loop is now unblocked by a functioning unit selection and hover-info system.

### Key Achievements:
*   **Selection System Fixed**: The `EnhancedSelectionSystem` has been successfully integrated into the UI layer (`GameHUD`), allowing for both single-unit and box selection. Units are now correctly detected.
*   **Hover Tooltips Implemented**: The `GameHUD` now correctly displays a tooltip with unit information when the player hovers over a unit.
*   **Stable Networking & State Sync**: The client-host model is working. The server correctly broadcasts unit state, and clients render the units.

### Identified Issues & Next Steps:
With selection working, the next step is to make units interactive.
*   **No Combat**: Units can be selected and moved, but they cannot attack each other. There is no concept of health, damage, or death.
*   **No Death Cycle**: When a unit should die, it is not removed from the game, and there is no feedback to the players.

## 2. Plan for Next Steps

The next phase of development will focus on implementing the full player interaction loop: **Select -> Command -> Execute**, with a focus on combat mechanics.

### Phase 2: Implement Combat and Death
**Goal**: Make combat interactive and meaningful.

*   **Task 1: Implement `attack` Action**
    *   **File**: `scripts/ai/plan_executor.gd`
    *   **Change**: Implement the logic for the `attack` action as a continuous state that only completes when the target is eliminated.
*   **Task 2: Implement Stateful Combat in `Unit`**
    *   **File**: `scripts/core/unit.gd`
    *   **Change**: Add an `ATTACKING` state to the unit's physics process, allowing it to autonomously pursue and attack its assigned target.
*   **Task 3: Implement Health and Death Cycle**
    *   **Files**: `scripts/core/unit.gd`, `scripts/server/server_game_state.gd`, `scripts/client/client_display_manager.gd`, `scripts/units/animated_unit.gd`
    *   **Change**: Connect the `unit_died` signal from the `Unit` to the `ServerGameState`. The `ServerGameState` will then remove the unit and broadcast its removal to all clients. Clients will then play a death animation and delete the unit's visual representation.

### Phase 3: AI Command & Control
**Goal**: Allow players to issue natural language commands to their units.

*   **Task 1: AI Command Input**
    *   **Files**: `scripts/ui/game_hud.gd`, `scripts/unified_main.gd`
    *   **Change**: Connect the command input field in the `GameHUD` to send an RPC to the server with the command text and selected units.
*   **Task 2: AI Command Processing**
    *   **File**: `scripts/ai/ai_command_processor.gd`
    *   **Change**: Implement the logic to take natural language text, send it to an LLM for translation into a structured plan, and validate the plan.
*   **Task 3: Plan Execution**
    *   **File**: `scripts/ai/plan_executor.gd`
    *   **Change**: Execute the validated plan on the specified units.
