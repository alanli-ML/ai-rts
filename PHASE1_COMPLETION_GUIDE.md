# Phase 1 Completion Guide

## What We've Completed

✅ Created complete directory structure
✅ Set up Git with proper .gitignore
✅ Configured project.godot with all settings
✅ Created all singleton scripts:
   - GameManager (game state management)
   - EventBus (global signal system)
   - ConfigManager (constants and settings)
✅ Created Logger utility class
✅ Created Map class for map management
✅ Created test setup script

## Manual Steps Required in Godot Editor

### 1. Create Main Scene (scenes/Main.tscn)
1. Open Godot and create a new 3D Scene
2. Rename the root Node3D to "Main"
3. Attach the test_setup.gd script to the Main node
4. Save as `res://scenes/Main.tscn`

### 2. Create Test Map Scene (scenes/maps/test_map.tscn)
1. Create a new 3D Scene
2. Rename root Node3D to "TestMap"
3. Attach the map.gd script to TestMap node
4. Add the following child nodes:

```
TestMap (Node3D) [attach: scripts/core/map.gd]
├── Environment (Node3D)
│   ├── DirectionalLight3D
│   ├── WorldEnvironment
│   └── Terrain (CSGBox3D)
├── CaptureNodes (Node3D)
├── SpawnPoints (Node3D)
│   ├── Team1Spawn (Marker3D)
│   └── Team2Spawn (Marker3D)
└── Camera (Camera3D)
```

### 3. Configure Environment Nodes

#### DirectionalLight3D:
- Transform → Rotation: X=-45, Y=-45, Z=0
- Light → Energy: 1.0
- Shadow → Enabled: ON

#### WorldEnvironment:
1. Create new Environment resource
2. Background → Mode: Sky
3. Background → Sky → Sky Material: New ProceduralSkyMaterial
4. Environment → Fog → Enabled: ON (optional)

#### Terrain (CSGBox3D):
- Size: X=100, Y=1, Z=100
- Material: Create new StandardMaterial3D
  - Albedo Color: Green (#4CAF50)

#### Camera:
- Position: Y=30, Z=20
- Rotation: X=-60

### 4. Position Spawn Points

#### Team1Spawn (Marker3D):
- Position: X=10, Y=0, Z=10

#### Team2Spawn (Marker3D):
- Position: X=90, Y=0, Z=90

### 5. Save and Test
1. Save the scene as `res://scenes/maps/test_map.tscn`
2. In Project Settings → Application → Run → Main Scene: select Main.tscn
3. Run the project (F5)

## Expected Output When Running

You should see in the console:
```
GameManager initialized
EventBus initialized
ConfigManager initialized
=== AI-RTS Test Setup ===
Game Version: 0.1.0
Godot Version: 4.4.x
[timestamp] [INFO] [Test] All systems initialized successfully
Game state changed from MENU to MENU
[timestamp] [INFO] [Test] Game state changed to: MENU
Game state changed from MENU to LOADING
[timestamp] [INFO] [Test] Game state changed to: LOADING
[timestamp] [INFO] [Map] Loading map: Test Map
Game state changed from LOADING to IN_GAME
[timestamp] [INFO] [Test] Game state changed to: IN_GAME
```

## Verify Everything Works

1. ✅ Console shows all singletons initialized
2. ✅ Game states transition correctly
3. ✅ Map loads with 9 capture nodes in a 3x3 grid
4. ✅ No errors in the console

## Optional: Download Kenney Assets

While not required for testing, you can download free 3D assets:
1. Visit https://kenney.nl/assets?q=3d
2. Download:
   - Tower Defense Kit
   - RTS Medieval Kit
   - Animated Characters 2
3. Extract to `res://assets/kenney/`

## Next Steps

Phase 1 is now complete! You have:
- A working project structure
- Core game management systems
- A test map with capture nodes
- Logging and debugging tools
