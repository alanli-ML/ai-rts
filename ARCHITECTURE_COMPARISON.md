# Architecture Comparison: P2P vs Dedicated Server

## üìä Current P2P Architecture Analysis

### **Current System Overview:**
- **Model**: ENetMultiplayerPeer host-client P2P
- **Capacity**: Maximum 2 players total
- **Authority**: Host has authority, but limited validation
- **Synchronization**: RPC-based with tick synchronization
- **AI Integration**: Client-side only (no sharing)

### **Current Communication Flow:**
```
Player A (Host) ‚Üê‚Üí Player B (Client)
     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
Local AI Process    Local AI Process
     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
Unit Commands      Unit Commands
     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
RPC Sync Issues    RPC Sync Issues
```

### **Current P2P Limitations:**

#### **üî¥ Critical Issues:**
1. **Single Point of Failure**: Host disconnection = match end
2. **No Scalability**: Hard limit of 2 players
3. **No Game State Sync**: Units, positions, health not synchronized
4. **AI Isolation**: AI commands not shared between teammates
5. **No Authority Model**: Conflicts from simultaneous actions
6. **No Persistence**: No recovery from disconnections

#### **üü° Operational Issues:**
1. **Network Instability**: P2P depends on both clients' connections
2. **Cheating Vulnerability**: Client-side validation only
3. **Sync Drift**: Game state can desync over time
4. **Limited Testing**: Only 2 players max for testing
5. **No Spectators**: Cannot observe matches
6. **No Reconnection**: Connection loss = permanent disconnect

## üéØ Dedicated Server Architecture Benefits

### **Target System Overview:**
- **Model**: Dedicated Godot headless server with ENetMultiplayerPeer
- **Capacity**: 100+ concurrent sessions, 4+ players per session
- **Authority**: Full server authority with MultiplayerSynchronizer
- **Synchronization**: Godot's native RPC system with delta compression
- **AI Integration**: Server-side processing with full RPC sharing

### **New Communication Flow:**
```
Player A ‚Üê‚Üí Godot Dedicated Server ‚Üê‚Üí Player B
            ‚Üì      ‚Üë      ‚Üì
         AI Service   MultiplayerSpawner
            ‚Üì      ‚Üë      ‚Üì
      Shared Commands  Unit Synchronization
            ‚Üì      ‚Üë      ‚Üì
     Authoritative Game State
