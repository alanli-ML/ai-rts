# Redundant Unit Spawning and Client Double-Load Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve redundant unit spawning and client-side double-loading issues.

## Issues Addressed

### ❌ **Redundant Unit Spawning Problem**
**Issue**: The legacy `StaticWorldInitializer` was spawning "placeholder" demo units alongside the proper units created by `SessionManager`, resulting in duplicate units on the server.

**Impact**: 
- Redundant placeholder units cluttering the game world
- Confusion between demo units and properly managed session units
- Performance impact from unnecessary unit instances
- Inconsistent unit behavior (demo units lacked proper archetype logic)

### ❌ **Client Double-Load Bug**
**Issue**: Clients were executing match start logic twice, causing duplicate map and HUD instances.

**Impact**:
- Duplicate game map instances loaded on client
- Duplicate HUD elements in UI
- Memory waste and performance degradation
- Potential UI interaction conflicts

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. StaticWorldInitializer Demo Unit Spawning Disabled (`scripts/core/static_world_initializer.gd`)

**Before (Problematic)**:
```gdscript
func initialize_units_3d() -> void:
    # ... session checks ...
    
    # Only spawn demo units if we're not in a proper multiplayer session
    print("StaticWorldInitializer: No active session found - spawning demo units for testing")
    _spawn_demo_units_for_teams()  # <- Creating redundant units!
    
    print("StaticWorldInitializer: Demo units spawned for both teams")
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```gdscript
func initialize_units_3d() -> void:
    # DISABLED: Demo unit spawning is disabled to prevent redundant placeholder units
    # All unit spawning is now handled exclusively by the SessionManager during matches
    print("StaticWorldInitializer: Demo unit spawning is disabled - units managed by SessionManager")
    
    # ... session checks ...
    
    # DISABLED: Demo unit spawning to prevent redundant units alongside SessionManager units
    # print("StaticWorldInitializer: No active session found - spawning demo units for testing")
    # _spawn_demo_units_for_teams()
    # 
    # print("StaticWorldInitializer: Demo units spawned for both teams")
    print("StaticWorldInitializer: Demo unit spawning disabled - no units created")
```

**Key Changes**:
- ✅ **Disabled `_spawn_demo_units_for_teams()` call** completely
- ✅ **Added clear documentation** explaining why demo spawning is disabled
- ✅ **Preserved demo unit functions** for potential future development use
- ✅ **Maintained session detection logic** for robustness

### 2. UnifiedMain Client Double-Load Fix (`scripts/unified_main.gd`)

**Before (Problematic)**:
```gdscript
@rpc("any_peer", "call_local", "reliable")
func _on_game_started(data: Dictionary) -> void:
    """Handle the game started signal from the server."""
    logger.info("UnifiedMain", "Game start signal received from server.")
    client_team_id = data.get("player_team", -1)
    _on_match_start_requested()
    _on_match_start_requested()  # <- DUPLICATE CALL!
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```gdscript
@rpc("any_peer", "call_local", "reliable")
func _on_game_started(data: Dictionary) -> void:
    """Handle the game started signal from the server."""
    logger.info("UnifiedMain", "Game start signal received from server.")
    client_team_id = data.get("player_team", -1)
    _on_match_start_requested()  # <- Single call only
```

**Key Changes**:
- ✅ **Removed duplicate `_on_match_start_requested()` call**
- ✅ **Preserved single call for proper match initialization**
- ✅ **Maintained all other functionality** in the method

## Unit Spawning Architecture

### ✅ **New Clean Architecture**

```
SessionManager (Authoritative)
    ↓
Spawns units during match initialization
    ↓
Units created with proper archetype logic
    ↓
No interference from legacy demo spawners
```

### ❌ **Old Problematic Architecture** 

```
SessionManager → Spawns proper units
      +
StaticWorldInitializer → Spawns demo units
    ↓
Result: Redundant duplicate units
```

## Client Match Start Flow

### ✅ **New Clean Flow**

```
Server sends _on_game_started RPC
    ↓
Client calls _on_match_start_requested() ONCE
    ↓
Map and HUD loaded properly (single instances)
```

### ❌ **Old Problematic Flow**

```
Server sends _on_game_started RPC
    ↓
Client calls _on_match_start_requested() TWICE
    ↓
Duplicate map and HUD instances created
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 🎯 **Unit Management**
- **Single Source of Truth**: Only SessionManager spawns units during matches
- **No Redundant Units**: Demo spawning completely disabled during active sessions
- **Proper Unit Logic**: All units now have correct archetype behavior
- **Performance Improvement**: No unnecessary unit instances

### 🎯 **Client Performance**
- **Single Map Instance**: No duplicate map loading
- **Single HUD Instance**: Clean UI without duplicates
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced memory usage on clients
- **Consistent State**: No conflicts between duplicate instances

### 🎯 **System Architecture**
- **Clear Separation**: Demo system disabled, production system active
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear documentation of disabled systems
- **Future-Proof**: Demo functions preserved for potential future use
- **Robust Design**: Proper error handling and logging

## Testing Validation

To verify these fixes are working:

### **Unit Spawning Verification**
1. **Start a multiplayer match**
2. **Check server console** - Should see "Demo unit spawning disabled" messages
3. **Verify unit count** - Should only see units spawned by SessionManager
4. **Test unit behavior** - All units should have proper archetype logic

### **Client Load Verification**
1. **Join a match as client**
2. **Monitor scene tree** - Should see single map and HUD instances
3. **Check memory usage** - Should be lower than before fix
4. **Test UI interactions** - Should work without conflicts

## Implementation Notes

### **StaticWorldInitializer**
- Demo unit functions are **commented out, not deleted**
- Can be re-enabled for **development testing** if needed
- **Clear documentation** explains the disabling rationale
- **Session detection logic preserved** for robustness

### **UnifiedMain**
- **Simple fix** with minimal impact on surrounding code
- **Preserved all other functionality** in `_on_game_started()`
- **No changes to RPC handling** or client team assignment

## Future Considerations

### **Demo Mode Development**
If demo unit spawning is needed in the future:
1. **Uncomment the demo spawning code** in StaticWorldInitializer
2. **Add a proper flag** to distinguish demo mode from production
3. **Ensure mutual exclusion** with SessionManager spawning

### **Enhanced Session Detection**
Consider adding more robust session state checking:
1. **Session state enumeration** (INACTIVE, LOBBY, ACTIVE, etc.)
2. **Explicit demo mode flag** in configuration
3. **Better coordination** between systems

The fixes ensure clean, efficient unit management and client loading without redundancy or conflicts.
