  - Weapon-type specific ejection patterns (pistol vs rifle)
  - Environmental interaction (shells bouncing off surfaces)
  
- **Weapon Recoil:**
  - Animation-driven weapon movement during `START_ATTACK` events
  - Archetype-specific recoil intensity (scout < soldier < tank)
  - Recovery timing synchronized with `FINISH_ATTACK`
  
- **Projectile Visualization:**
  - Instant-hit vs projectile weapon handling
  - Muzzle velocity calculation from weapon stats
  - Tracer effects for automatic weapons

#### **Integration Points:**
