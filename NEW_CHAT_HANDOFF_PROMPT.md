- **Visual Unit Models**: Replace placeholder spheres with proper Kenney 3D models
- **Unit Abilities**: Implement the 5 unit archetypes with their specific abilities
- **Unit Selection**: Enhanced selection system with proper visual feedback

### **Priority 3: Speech Bubble System**
- **Visual Communication**: Speech bubbles above units for team coordination
- **12-word limit**: Concise communication with AI-generated responses
- **Team visibility**: Communication visible to teammates
- **AI integration**: Units can "speak" their status and intentions

### **Priority 4: Building System Integration**
- **Asset Integration**: Use Kenney building assets for Power Spire, Defense Tower, Relay Pad
- **Building Placement**: Implement proper building placement and construction
- **Resource Integration**: Connect buildings to the resource management system
