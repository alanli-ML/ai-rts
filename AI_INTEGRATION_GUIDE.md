- **I**: Test AI command processing
- **O**: Check AI system status
- **P**: Test voice command simulation

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Basic Commands
```
"Move the selected units to the center"
"All scouts move to position 20 0 20"
"Attack the enemy tank"
"Stop all units"
```

### Formation Commands
```
"Form a line formation"
"Arrange units in a wedge"
"Scatter the selected units"
"Column formation, move forward"
```

### Unit-Specific Commands
```
"Medic unit heal nearby allies"
"Sniper take overwatch position"
"Engineers repair the damaged building"
"Tank units charge the enemy"
```

### Combat Commands
```

```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### OpenAI API Client Features
- **Rate Limiting**: 60 requests/minute, 5 concurrent
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types and recovery
- **Request Queuing**: Automatic queuing when rate limited
- **Response Parsing**: JSON validation and sanitization

### AI Command Processing
- **Context Building**: Game state, selected units, team information
- **Command Validation**: Sanitizes and validates AI responses
- **Command History**: Tracks recent commands for context
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of invalid AI responses

### Command Translation
- **Unit Resolution**: Supports "selected", "all", "type:scout", and unit IDs
- **Formation Support**: Line, column, wedge, and scattered formations
- **Action Mapping**: Move, attack, patrol, abilities, stance changes
- **Safety Validation**: Parameter sanitization and bounds checking

## üìä AI System Monitoring

### Status Information
```gdscript
var ai_status = game_controller.get_ai_status()
# Returns:
# {
#   "ai_available": true,
#   "processing": false,
#   "queue_size": 0,
#   "selected_units": 3
# }
```

### Usage Metrics
```gdscript
var usage_info = openai_client.get_usage_info()
# Returns:
# {
#   "active_requests": 1,
#   "queued_requests": 0,
#   "requests_last_minute": 15,
#   "rate_limit": 60
# }
```

## üß™ Testing Framework

### Automated AI Testing
The system includes comprehensive testing controls:

1. **Command Processing Tests**: 8 different command types
2. **Status Monitoring**: Real-time AI system status
3. **Error Handling**: Validation of error recovery
4. **Context Testing**: Game state integration
5. **Unit Integration**: Proper unit command execution

### Test Commands (Press 'I' in game)
- Move commands with formations
- Attack commands with target resolution
- Patrol commands with waypoints
- Ability usage commands
- Stance and formation changes

## üîç Debugging

### Logging System
All AI operations are logged with context:
```
[INFO] AICommandProcessor: Processing command: Move scouts forward
[INFO] OpenAIClient: Request sent to OpenAI API
[INFO] CommandTranslator: Moving 3 units to position (20, 0, 20)
```

### Error Diagnostics
Common issues and solutions:

**API Key Issues**
- Check environment variable or config setting
- Verify API key has sufficient credits
- Ensure network connectivity

**Command Processing Errors**
- AI response format validation
- Unit resolution failures
- Parameter sanitization issues
