# Implementation Status & Next Steps

## 1. Current Status Summary

The project's core systems are stable. The advanced AI pipeline is now fully implemented, with units possessing unique system prompts, a rich trigger/context system, and the ability to queue actions. Autonomous behavior for idle units is now functional.

### Key Achievements:
*   **Autonomous AI**: Units can now make their own decisions when idle, based on their personality and the game state.
*   **Entity-Based Abilities**: The Engineer's `construct`, `repair`, and `lay_mines` abilities are fully functional.
*   **Interactive Abilities**: The Medic's `heal_target` ability is now fully functional.
*   **Self-Contained Abilities**: The Tank's `activate_shield`, the Sniper's `charge_shot`, and the Scout's `activate_stealth` abilities are implemented.
*   **Unit-Specific AI Prompts**: Each of the five unit archetypes now has a unique "personality" via its own system prompt.

## 2. Plan for Next Steps

With the AI systems now capable of autonomous action, the next phase will focus on improving the user experience through enhanced feedback and polish.

### Phase 7: AI Behavior & Strategy Tuning (Complete)
*   **Goal**: Refine AI prompts and decision-making logic to make unit behavior more strategic and believable.
*   **Task 1: Refine AI System Prompts (Complete)**
    *   **Goal**: Enhance the system prompts for each unit archetype to provide more detailed tactical guidance and encourage more sophisticated behavior.
    *   **Change**: Rewrote the `system_prompt` for all five unit types.
    *   **Files**: `scripts/units/engineer_unit.gd`, `scripts/units/medic_unit.gd`, `scripts/units/scout_unit.gd`, `scripts/units/sniper_unit.gd`, `scripts/units/tank_unit.gd`.
*   **Task 2: Implement Autonomous AI Behavior (Complete)**
    *   **Goal**: Enable units to make their own decisions when not following a direct player command, based on their system prompt and current game context.
    *   **Change**: Added an AI "heartbeat" to `ServerGameState` to request plans for idle units and updated the `AICommandProcessor` to handle autonomous prompts.
    *   **Files**: `scripts/server/server_game_state.gd`, `scripts/ai/ai_command_processor.gd`.

### Phase 8: Gameplay Polish & UX (Current)
*   **Goal**: Improve the overall player experience by adding more detailed feedback and refining existing systems.
*   **Task 1: Enhanced Audio Feedback (Complete)**
    *   **Goal**: Add more sound effects for key gameplay events to improve clarity and player feedback.
    *   **Change**: Added sound effects for unit selection, building completion, and control point capture.
    *   **Files**: `scripts/core/unit.gd`, `scripts/gameplay/building_entity.gd`, `scripts/gameplay/control_point.gd`.
*   **Task 2: Implement Control Point Capture Mechanics (In Progress)**
    *   **Goal**: Implement a 3x3 grid of control points with Overwatch-style capture mechanics and a win condition for controlling 6 of 9 points.
    *   **Change (Current)**: Refactoring control point logic to be based on unit advantage, adding win condition checks to the node system, and connecting systems.
    *   **Files**: `scripts/gameplay/control_point.gd`, `scripts/gameplay/node_capture_system.gd`, `scripts/server/server_game_state.gd`.

## AI System Specification (Updated)

### 1. Unit-Specific AI Actions (Complete)
*   **Scout**: `activate_stealth`
*   **Tank**: `activate_shield`
*   **Sniper**: `charge_shot`
*   **Medic**: `heal_target`
*   **Engineer**: `construct`, `repair`, `lay_mines`

### 2. Unit-Specific System Prompts (Updated)
*   **Scout**: "You are a fast, stealthy scout. Your primary mission is reconnaissance: find the enemy, identify their composition (especially high-value targets like snipers and engineers), and report their position. Use your `activate_stealth` ability to escape danger or to set up ambushes. Avoid direct combat unless you have a clear advantage. Prioritize survival above all else."
*   **Tank**: "You are a heavy tank, the spearhead of our assault. Your job is to absorb damage and protect your allies. Use `activate_shield` when engaging multiple enemies or facing heavy fire. Always try to be at the front of your squad, drawing enemy fire. Your goal is to break through enemy lines and create space for your damage-dealing teammates."
*   **Sniper**: "You are a long-range precision sniper. Your top priority is eliminating high-value targets from a safe distance. High-value targets include enemy snipers, medics, and engineers. Use your `charge_shot` ability on stationary or high-health targets. Always maintain maximum distance from the enemy. If enemies get too close, retreat to a safer position. You are not a front-line fighter."
*   **Medic**: "You are a combat medic. Your primary directive is to keep your teammates alive. Stay near your squad and automatically use `heal_target` on any injured ally who is not at full health. Prioritize healing units that are under fire or have the lowest health. You should avoid direct combat and position yourself safely behind your teammates."
*   **Engineer**: "You are a combat engineer. Your main role is to build and maintain our infrastructure. Use `construct` to build structures at captured nodes. Your secondary role is to use `repair` on damaged buildings or allied units. When not building or repairing, you can support your squad in combat or use `lay_mines` to create defensive minefields at strategic chokepoints or to protect our base."

### 3. Action Queue Management (Complete)
*   The `unit_state` object in the AI context now contains an `action_queue`, which is the unit's current plan (max 3 steps). The AI's response replaces this queue, allowing for dynamic, state-aware replanning.
