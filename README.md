Comprehensive PRD – Prompt-Driven RTS
(Godot 4 × OpenAI, Kenney assets, multiplayer-first, no inter-unit comms)

1 Project Overview
A competitive 1-v-1 (optionally 2-v-2) RTS in which each player is a cloud-AI commanding ≤ 10 personality-rich robo-minions.
Players issue natural-language commands; an OpenAI back-end converts them into validated multi-step “plans” that cover several seconds of gameplay. Godot runs a deterministic 60 Hz simulation; minions see only what is in their vision cone, speak short lines in comic bubbles, and follow user-defined system prompts that shape their style.

2 Core Workflows & Features
Lobby & Matchmaking – Host/join ranked or custom games; select map & team size.

Unit Load-out & Personality – Pre-match UI lets players attach a short System Prompt to each minion (e.g., “Cautious sniper who hates tanks”).

Prompt-to-Plan Loop – Player text or quick-command → batch prompt (includes System Prompt) → OpenAI → JSON plan → Validator → engine.

Vision-Bound Knowledge – Unit packets contain only objects in a 120° / 30 m cone; no global knowledge sharing.

Node Capture & Micro-Bases – Flip neutral nodes; auto-build Power Spire, Defense Tower, or Relay Pad (one slot per node).

Expanded Action Space – Composite moves (peek_and_fire), conditional orders (if_health<40 retreat), area denial (lay_mines), sabotage (hijack_enemy_spire).

Speech Bubbles – Each plan step may carry a ≤ 12-word speech line that renders over the unit for 2 s when the step starts.

Finite-State Machine Guard – Engine FSM enforces cooldowns, ranges, and emergency overrides (automatic retreat if HP < 20 %).

Victory – Hold ≥ 60 % of nodes or destroy rival HQ; at 5 min a sudden-death Energy drain accelerates the finish.

Post-Match Summary – Shows node flips, kill log, “Best Prompt,” “Funniest Line,” local ELO delta.

                    "retreat:{cover_id}" ]
}
4.2 OpenAI Structured Outputs Integration
The system now uses OpenAI's structured outputs with strict JSON schemas instead of prompt engineering. This eliminates parsing errors and AI hallucinations while providing robust validation.

**Key Features:**
- **Archetype-Specific Actions**: Scout units get `activate_stealth`, Engineer units get `construct`/`repair`
- **Structured Triggers**: Three-field validation (source, comparison, value) replaces string parsing
- **Type Safety**: All parameters strictly validated with `additionalProperties: false`
- **Null Parameters**: Actions like `patrol` and `lay_mines` can use `null` for no parameters

**Schema Generation:**
```gdscript
# Dynamic schema based on unit archetypes
var schema = AIResponseSchemas.get_schema_for_command(is_group, ["scout", "engineer"])
```

4.3 LLM Response Schema (Strategic Plan)
```json
{
  "plans": [
    {
      "unit_id": "tank_t1_01",
      "goal": "Lead an aggressive assault on the central control points.",
      "control_point_attack_sequence": ["Center", "East", "Southeast"],
      "primary_state_priority_list": ["attack", "defend", "follow", "retreat"]
    },
    {
      "unit_id": "medic_t1_01",
      "goal": "Support the tank in the main assault.",
      "control_point_attack_sequence": ["Center", "East", "Southeast"],
      "primary_state_priority_list": ["follow", "defend", "retreat", "attack"]
    },
    {
      "unit_id": "scout_t1_01",
      "goal": "Flank west to capture weakly defended points.",
      "control_point_attack_sequence": ["West", "Southwest"],
      "primary_state_priority_list": ["attack", "follow", "defend", "retreat"]
    }
  ],
  "message": "Assaulting the center with the main force while the scout flanks west.",
  "summary": "Main assault and east flank."
}
```

**Strategic Plan:** The LLM's role has been elevated to that of a high-level strategist. Instead of defining a detailed `behavior_matrix`, it now provides a plan for each individual unit with:
- **`unit_id`**: The unique ID of the unit this plan is for.
- **`control_point_attack_sequence`**: An ordered list of objectives.
- **`primary_state_priority_list`**: An ordered list of the four primary combat states (`attack`, `defend`, `retreat`, `follow`).

The game engine's **Behavior Tuning System** uses this priority list to perform a one-time algorithmic adjustment of the unit's behavior matrix. The `PlanExecutor` receives the plan, fetches a base behavior matrix for the unit's archetype, and modifies the `bias` values for the four primary states to match the specified priority. This tuned matrix is then sent to the unit, giving it a fixed strategic personality that allows it to react dynamically to battlefield conditions until a new command is issued.

**Action Enums by Archetype:**
- **General**: `move_to`, `attack`, `retreat`, `patrol`, `stance`, `follow`
- **Scout**: `+activate_stealth` 
- **Tank**: `+activate_shield`, `+taunt_enemies`
- **Sniper**: `+charge_shot`, `+find_cover`
- **Medic**: `+heal_ally`
- **Engineer**: `+construct_turret`, `+repair`, `+lay_mines`

Note over Unit: The Unit executes its tuned behavior matrix,<br/>reacting dynamically to the environment<br/>with a fixed strategic personality.

Module	Role
ActionValidator.gd	Validates the `primary_state_priority_list` and `control_point_attack_sequence` from the LLM. Ensures the priority list contains the four valid, unique primary states.
PlanExecutor.gd	A "behavior tuner". It receives validated group plans, generates a tuned `behavior_matrix` for each unit by algorithmically adjusting biases based on the `primary_state_priority_list`, and sends the final plan to the units.
Unit.gd	The core of the unit's reactive AI. It receives a tuned `behavior_matrix` from the `PlanExecutor`. Every physics frame, it evaluates its environment, calculates action activation scores using the matrix, and executes the best action, allowing it to react dynamically with a fixed strategic personality.
PathPlanner.gd	(Now integrated into `Unit.gd` via `NavigationAgent3D`) Handles 60 Hz pathfinding and local avoidance.
SpeechBubble.tscn	Billboard UI; fades after 2 s.

6 Expanded Action & Sensing Space
Category	Examples	Engine Enforcement
Composite	peek_and_fire, bound_over	Needs cover id, dir; checks LoS.
Conditional	if_health<40 retreat:{cover_id}	Validator parses trigger grammar.
Area Denial	lay_mines:{pattern=arc,count=3}	Checks mine cap & cooldown.
Sabotage	hijack_enemy_spire:{node_id}	Node must be enemy & unshielded.

Sensor block enhancements (cover_tiles, danger_grid) enable better tactical reasoning; engine sends only nearest N entries to stay within token budget.

7 Performance & Tick Rates
Layer	Cadence	Notes
Physics / Anim	60 Hz	Predictive client interpolation.
FSM & PlanExec	30 Hz	Step activation & emergency AI.
LLM Brain Tick	0.5–2 Hz (GPT-4o batch)
6 Hz (local 13 B)	One multi-step plan covers up to 6 s.

Prompt ≤ 60 tokens; reply ≤ 35 tokens → GPT-4o batch (32 units) ≈ 0.5 s.

8 Safety & Cheat Mitigation
Deterministic lock-step; every plan + state diff hashed to replay log.

ActionValidator refuses out-of-bounds params, unknown triggers, excessive durations.

Speech moderated via word-list / OpenAI moderation.

Per-player prompt rate-limit (120 / min).

Immediate fallback AI if LLM latency > 5 s.

9 MVP Launch Requirements
Online 1-v-1 Sync ≥ 15 min; replay deterministic.

OpenAI Loop ≤ 1 s median; fallback AI path.

Five Minion Archetypes + editable System Prompts.

Three Buildings + Energy operational.

Single 9-Node Map with fog-of-war & Kenney assets.

Vision Service limiting sensor block.

Plan Schema (multi-step, triggers, speech) with peek_and_fire, retreat, lay_mines, hijack_enemy_spire.

Speech Bubble System integrated.

Prompt UI – radial + free text; ≥ 6 quick commands.

Validator, PathPlanner, PlanExecutor fully wired to FSM.

Post-Match Screen – node %, HQ kill, Best Prompt, Funniest Line, local ELO.

Delivering these elements produces a public-alpha RTS where vision-bound, personality-driven minions execute multi-step plans, speak back to players, and fight intelligently—all within a cheat-proof deterministic core.


ORIGINAL PRD:


Comprehensive PRD – Prompt-Driven RTS
(Godot 4 × OpenAI, Kenney assets, multiplayer-first, no inter-unit comms)

1 Project Overview
A competitive 1-v-1 (optionally 2-v-2) RTS in which each player—portraying a cloud-AI—commands ≤ 10 personality-rich robo-minions and builds compact bases across a chain of floating “data-islands.”
Natural-language prompts are transformed by an OpenAI back-end into validated multi-step plans; Godot executes a deterministic 60 Hz simulation.
Minions perceive only what lies in their vision cones, follow user-defined System Prompts, speak brief lines in comic bubbles, construct and repair structures, and fight intelligently—all within a cheat-proof core.

2 Core Workflows & Features
Lobby & Matchmaking – Host / join ranked or custom games; pick map, team size.

Unit Load-out & Personality – Pre-match screen: assign a short System Prompt to every minion (e.g., “Reckless flamethrower who loves rushes”).

Prompt-to-Plan Loop – Player text or quick-command → batched prompt (with System Prompt) → OpenAI → JSON plan → validator → engine.

Vision-Bound Knowledge – Each Unit Packet contains only what the minion sees in a 120 ° / 30 m cone (plus local heat map).

Node Capture – Destroy or hack a neutral / enemy node to establish a base platform and unlock one structure slot.

Construction & Bases

Structure Types (MVP)

HQ – initial spawn; loss = defeat condition.

Power Spire – yields Energy (economy tick).

Defense Tower – autonomous projectile turret with 180 ° arc.

Relay Pad – forward respawn / teleport & ammo refill.

Build Flow – A Builder minion issues construct:{node_id,type}; structure appears with construction_progress = 0 → 1 over N seconds.

Upkeep & Repair – Builder can repair:{building_id}; any minion can sabotage:{building_id} (enemy).

Expanded Action Space – Composite (peek_and_fire), Conditional (if_health<40 retreat), Building (construct, repair), Area-Denial (lay_mines), Sabotage (hijack_enemy_spire).

Speech Bubbles – Each plan step may include speech ≤ 12 words; shown 2 s above the unit when that step starts.

Finite-State Machine Guard – FSM enforces cooldowns, ranges, emergency retreat if HP < 20 %.

Victory – Control ≥ 60 % nodes or destroy rival HQ; at 5 min, sudden-death Energy drain speeds finish.

Post-Match Summary – Node flips, structure stats, kill log, “Best Prompt,” “Funniest Line,” local ELO delta.
