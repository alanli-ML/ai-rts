- **Visual Communication**: Speech bubbles above units for team coordination
- **12-word limit**: Concise communication with AI-generated responses
- **Team visibility**: Communication visible to teammates
- **AI integration**: Units can "speak" their status and intentions

### **Priority 3: Core Gameplay Features**
- **Building System**: Power Spire, Defense Tower, Relay Pad (3 types)
- **Node Capture**: 9 strategic control points with victory conditions

The project has successfully completed a **major architectural transformation**:
- ✅ **Single Codebase**: No more duplication between client and server
- ✅ **Runtime Mode Detection**: Automatic server/client configuration
- ✅ **Dependency Injection**: Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ **Testing Validated**: System runs successfully with proper initialization

### **Next Critical Priority: Multi-Step Plan Execution System**
The **Multi-Step Plan Execution System** is the core differentiator from the original MVP. This system allows units to execute complex, multi-step plans with triggers and timing:

```
"If enemy approaches within 15 units, fall back to defensive position. 
If health drops below 30%, retreat to medic. 
If no enemies visible for 10 seconds, advance to patrol route."
```

**Without this system**: Game is just "RTS with AI commands"
**With this system**: Game becomes "AI-driven RTS with sophisticated behavior"

### **Architecture is Production-Ready**
The unified architecture provides:
- **Scalability**: 100+ client capacity
- **Maintainability**: Single codebase, no duplication
- **Flexibility**: Runtime mode switching
- **Performance**: Optimized with shared components
