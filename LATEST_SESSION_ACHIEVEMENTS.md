## 🏆 **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGHS ACHIEVED**

### **✅ Input System Excellence - WASD Conflict Resolution**
**Problem**: Multiple test scripts were intercepting WASD input events, causing conflicts with camera movement
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive input isolation system
- **Before**: Test scripts automatically handled input, conflicting with camera controls
- **After**: Test scripts use Ctrl+T toggle system, camera movement isolated and working perfectly
- **Technical**: Added `testing_enabled` flags with deferred setup and retry mechanisms

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/test/ai_demo_with_units.gd` - Added testing toggle system
- `scripts/test/comprehensive_unit_control_test.gd` - Implemented input isolation

### **✅ Unit Movement Execution - Command Pipeline Fix** 
**Problem**: AI commands were being processed but units weren't actually moving
**Solution**: Fixed command execution chain and position handling
- **Before**: AI generated commands but units remained stationary
- **After**: Units properly respond to retreat/movement commands with correct target positions
- **Technical**: Fixed `_execute_retreat` function to use AI-generated positions instead of ignoring them

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/ai/command_translator.gd` - Fixed position handling in retreat execution
- `scripts/core/unit.gd` - Added comprehensive debug logging for movement tracking

### **✅ Complete LangSmith Integration - Full Observability**
**Problem**: LangSmith traces weren't appearing in dashboard despite successful API calls
**Solution**: Fixed timestamp handling, trace lifecycle, and environment configuration
- **Before**: 202 API responses but no traces visible in LangSmith dashboard
- **After**: Complete trace lifecycle with proper creation, completion, and timestamp handling
- **Technical**: Fixed Unix time formatting, added retry mechanisms, and proper UUID generation

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/ai/langsmith_client.gd` - Fixed timestamp formatting and trace lifecycle
- `scripts/ai/ai_command_processor.gd` - Added deferred setup and retry mechanism
- `scripts/core/dependency_container.gd` - Enhanced LangSmith client initialization
- `.env` - Created with proper LangSmith configuration template

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **Input System Architecture**
```gdscript
# Before: Automatic input handling causing conflicts
func _input(event: InputEvent) -> void:
    # Always handling input

# After: Controlled input with toggle system  
var testing_enabled: bool = false

func _input(event: InputEvent) -> void:
    if event.keycode == KEY_T and Input.is_action_pressed("ctrl"):
        testing_enabled = !testing_enabled
    if not testing_enabled:
        return
```

### **Command Execution Pipeline**
```gdscript
# Before: Ignoring AI-generated positions
func _execute_retreat(units: Array, parameters: Dictionary) -> String:
    var retreat_pos = global_position + Vector3.BACK * 10

# After: Using AI-generated target positions
func _execute_retreat(units: Array, parameters: Dictionary) -> String:
    if parameters.has("position"):
        var position = parameters.position
        var retreat_pos = Vector3(position[0], position[1], position[2])
        for unit in units:
            unit.move_to(retreat_pos)
```

### **LangSmith Observability**
```gdscript
# Before: Engine ticks causing 1970 timestamps
func _format_timestamp(timestamp: float) -> String:
    var datetime = Time.get_datetime_dict_from_unix_time(timestamp)

# After: Proper Unix time handling
func _format_timestamp(timestamp: float) -> String:
    var unix_time = Time.get_unix_time_from_system()
    var datetime = Time.get_datetime_dict_from_unix_time(int(unix_time))
```
